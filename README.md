# Restaurant Page

This is a restaurant page written in JS, CSS and HTML, the objective of this project is learning how to write single page applications using only Javascript
to render all the necessary DOM elements and display different 'pages' when the user navigates to them. 

## Key takeaways

In hindsight this project taught me about how an SPA can be created in vanilla JS, as opposed to using a framework. When I started learning a framework I could
clearly see the value that a framework can bring and the differences between a framework and the vanilla approach when it comes to rendering components, organizing modules and even routing.
To conclude, this is a simple project and at the time I completed it I didn't think much of it but it gave me a lot of insight and 'food for thought' when I moved towards learning a framework.
